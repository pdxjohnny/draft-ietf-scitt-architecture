 An Architecture for Trustworthy and Transparent Digital Supply Chains
                  draft-ietf-scitt-architecture-latest

Abstract

   Traceability of physical and digital Artifacts in supply chains is a
   long-standing, but increasingly serious security concern.  The rise
   in popularity of verifiable data structures as a mechanism to make
   actors more accountable for breaching their compliance promises has
   found some successful applications to specific use cases (such as the
   supply chain for digital certificates), but lacks a generic and
   scalable architecture that can address a wider range of use cases.

   This document defines a generic, interoperable and scalable
   architecture to enable transparency across any supply chain with
   minimum adoption barriers.  It provides flexibility, enabling
   interoperability across different implementations of Transparency
   Services with various auditing and compliance requirements.
   Producers can register their Signed Statements on any Transparency
   Service, with the guarantee that all Consumers will be able to verify
   them.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a scalable and flexible, decentralized
   architecture to enhance auditability and accountability across
   various existing and emerging supply chains.  It achieves this goal
   by enforcing the following complementary security guarantees:

   1.  Statements made by Issuers about supply chain Artifacts must be
       identifiable, authentic, and non-repudiable

   2.  Such Statements must be registered on a secure append-only Log,
       so that their provenance and history can be independently and
       consistently audited

   3.  Issuers can efficiently prove to any other party the Registration
       of their Signed Statements; verifying this proof ensures that the
       Issuer is consistent and non-equivocal when producing Signed
       Statements

   The first guarantee is achieved by requiring Issuers to sign their
   Statements and associated metadata using a distributed public key
   infrastructure.  The second guarantee is achieved by storing the
   Signed Statement on an immutable, append-only Log. The next guarantee
   is achieved by implementing the append-only Log using a verifiable
   data structure (such as a Merkle Tree [MERKLE]).  Lastly, the
   Transparency Service verifies the identity of the Issuer, and
   conformance to a Registration Policy associated with the instance of
   the Transparency Service.  As the Issuer of the Signed Statement and
   conformance to the Registration Policy are confirmed, an endorsement
   is made as the Signed Statement is added to the append-only Log.

   The guarantees and techniques used in this document generalize those
   of Certificate Transparency [RFC9162], which can be re-interpreted as
   an instance of this architecture for the supply chain of X.509
   certificates.  However, the range of use cases and applications in
   this document is much broader, which requires much more flexibility
   in how each Transparency Service is implemented and operates.  Each
   service MAY enforce its own Registration Policies for authorizing
   entities to register their Signed Statements to the append-only Log.
   Some Transparency Services may also enforce authorization policies
   limiting who can write, read and audit specific Subjects or the full
   registry.  It is critical to provide interoperability for all
   Transparency Services instances as the composition and configuration
   of involved supply chain entities and their system components is
   ever-changing and always in flux, so it is implausible to expect all
   participants to choose a single vendor or registry.

   A Transparency Service provides visibility into Signed Statements
   associated with various supply chains and their sub-systems.  These
   Signed Statements (and corresponding Statement payload) make claims
   about the Artifacts produced by a supply chain.  A Transparency
   Service endorses specific and well-defined metadata about these
   Artifacts that is captured in Statements.  Some metadata is selected
   (and signed) by the Issuer, indicating, e.g., "who issued the
   Statement" or "what type of Artifact is described" or "what is the
   Artifact's version"; whereas additional metadata is selected (and
   countersigned) by the Transparency Services, indicating, e.g., "when
   was the Signed Statement about the Artifact registered in the
   Registry".  Producing a Transparent Statement may be considered a
   form of notarization.  A Statements payload content MAY be encrypted
   and opaque to the Transparency Services, if so desired: however the
   metadata MUST be transparent in order to warrant trust for later
   processing.  Transparent Statements provide a common basis for
   holding Issuers accountable for the Statement payload about Artifacts
   they release and (more generally) principals accountable for
   auxiliary Signed Statements from other Issuers about the original
   Signed Statement about an Artifact.  Issuers may Register new Signed
   Statements about Artifacts, but they cannot delete or alter Signed
   Statements previously added to the append-only Log. A Transparency
   Service may restrict access to Signed Statements through access
   control policies.  However, third parties (such as Auditors) would be
   granted access as needed to attest to the validity of the Artifact,
   Subject or the entirety of the Transparency Service.

   Trust in the Transparency Service itself is supported both by
   protecting their implementation (using, for instance, replication,
   trusted hardware, and remote attestation of a system's operational
   state) and by enabling independent audits of the correctness and
   consistency of its Registry, thereby holding the organization that
   operates it accountable.  Unlike CT, where independent Auditors are
   responsible for enforcing the consistency of multiple independent
   instances of the same global Registry, each Transparency Service is
   required to guarantee the consistency of its own Registry (for
   instance, through the use of a consensus algorithm between replicas
   of the Registry), but assume no consistency between different
   Transparency Services.

   Breadth of access is critical so the Transparency Service specified
   in this architecture cater to two types of audiences:

   1.  Producers: organizations, stakeholders, and users involved in
       creating or attesting to supply chain artifacts, releasing
       authentic Statements to a definable set of peers; and

   2.  Consumers: organizations, stakeholders, and users involved in
       validating supply chain artifacts, but can only do so if the
       Statements are known to be authentic.  Consumers MAY be
       producers, providing additional Signed Statements, attesting to
       conformance of various compliance requirements.

   Signed Statement Issuers rely on being discoverable and represented
   as the responsible parties for their registered Signed Statements via
   Transparency Services in a believable manner.  The issuer of a Signed
   Statement must be authenticated and authorized according to the
   registration policy of the Transparency Service.  Analogously,
   Transparent Statement Consumers rely on verifiable trustworthiness
   assertions associated with Transparent Statements and their
   processing provenance in a believable manner.  If trust can be put
   into the operations that record Signed Statements in a secure,
   append-only log via online operations, the same trust can be put into
   the resulting transparent statement, issued by the Transparency
   Services and that can be validated in offline operations.

   The Transparency Services specified in this architecture can be
   implemented by various different types of services in various types
   of languages provided via various variants of API layouts.

   The interoperability guaranteed by the Transparency Services is
   enabled via core components (architectural constituents) that come
   with prescriptive requirements (that are typically hidden away from
   the user audience via APIs but can be relied upon as non functional
   requirements).  Many of the data elements processed by the core
   components are based on the Concise Signing and Encryption standard
   specified in [RFC9052], which is used to produce Signed Statements
   about Artifacts and to build and maintain a Merkle tree that
   functions as an append-only Log for corresponding Signed Statements.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Use Cases

   The building blocks defined in SCITT are intended to support
   applications in any supply chain that produces or relies upon digital
   artifacts, from the build and supply of software and IoT devices to
   advanced manufacturing and food supply.

   Detailed use cases are maintained in a separate document
   [I-D.ietf-scitt-software-use-cases].

3.  Terminology

   The terms defined in this section have special meaning in the context
   of Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust throughout this
   document.  When used in text, the corresponding terms are
   capitalized.  To ensure readability, only a core set of terms is
   included in this section.

   Artifact:  a physical or non-physical item that is moving along the
      supply chain.

   Auditor:  an entity that checks the correctness and consistency of
      all Transparent Statements issued by a Transparency Service.

   Consumer of Signed Statements:  Define here.

   Envelope:  metadata and an Issuer's signature is added to a Statement
      via a COSE Envelope by the Issuer to produce a Signed Statement.
      The Envelope contains the identity of the Issuer and information
      about the Artifact to help Transparency Services to properly
      validate and process the Signed Statement.  In essence, a Signed
      Statement is a COSE Envelope wrapped around a Statement binding
      the metadata included in the Envelope to a Statement.  In COSE, an
      Envelope consists of a protected header (included in the Issuer's
      signature) and an unprotected header (not included in the Issuer's
      signature).

   Subject:  a logical collection of Statements about the same Artifact.
      For any step or set of steps in a supply chain there will be
      multiple statements made about the same Artifact.  Issuers use the
      Feed to create a coherent sequence of Signed Statements about the
      same Artifact and Verifiers use the Feed to ensure completeness
      and non-equivocation in supply chain evidence by identifying all
      Transparent Statements linked to the one(s) they are evaluating.
      In COSE, Subject is a dedicated header attribute in the protected
      header of the Envelope.

   Issuer:  an entity that creates Signed Statements about Artifacts in
      the supply chain.  An Issuer may be the owner or author of
      Artifacts, or an independent third party such as a reviewer or an
      endorser.

   Append-only Log (converges Ledger and Registry):  the verifiable
      append-only data structure that stores Signed Statements in a
      Transparency Service.  SCITT supports multiple Log and Receipt
      formats to accommodate different Transparency Service
      implementations, such as historical Merkle Trees and sparse Merkle
      Trees.

   Receipt:  a Receipt is a cryptographic proof that a Signed Statement
      is recorded in the Registry.  Receipts are based on COSE Signed
      Merkle Tree Proofs [I-D.draft-steele-cose-merkle-tree-proofs];
      they consist of a Registry-specific inclusion proof, a signature
      by the Transparency Service of the state of the Registry, and
      additional metadata (contained in the signature's protected
      headers) to assist in auditing.

   Registration:  the process of submitting a Signed Statement to a
      Transparency Service, applying the Transparency Service's
      Registration Policy, and producing a Receipt.

   Registration Policy:  the pre-condition enforced by the Transparency
      Service before registering a Signed Statement, rendering it a
      Signed Statement, based on metadata contained in its COSE Envelope
      (notably the identity of its Issuer) and on prior Signed
      Statements already added to a Registry.

   Registry:  the verifiable append-only data structure that stores
      Signed Statements in a Transparency Service often referred to by
      the synonym log or ledger.  Since COSE Signed Merkle Tree Proofs
      ([I-D.draft-steele-cose-merkle-tree-proofs]) support multiple
      Merkle Tree algorithms, SCITT supports different Transparency
      Service implementations of the Registry, such as historical Merkle
      Trees or sparse Merkle Trees.

   Signed Statement:  an identifiable and non-repudiable Statement about
      an Artifact made by an Issuer.  In SCITT, Signed Statements are
      encoded as COSE signed objects; the payload of the COSE structure
      contains the issued Statement.

   Statement:  any serializable information about an Artifact.  To help
      interpretation of Statements, they must be tagged with a media
      type (as specified in [RFC6838]).  For example, a Statement may
      represent a Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) that lists the
      ingredients of a software Artifact, or some endorsement or
      attestation about an Artifact.

   Transparency Service:  an entity that maintains and extends the
      Registry, and endorses its state.  A Transparency Service is often
      referred to by its synonym Notary.  A Transparency Service can be
      a complex distributed system, and SCITT requires the Transparency
      Service to provide many security guarantees about its Registry.
      The identity of a Transparency Service is captured by a public key
      that must be known by Verifiers in order to validate Receipts.

   Transparent Statement:  a Signed Statement that is augmented with a
      Receipt created via Registration in a Transparency Service (the
      receipt is stored in the unprotected header of COSE Envelope of
      the Signed Statement).  A Transparent Statement remains a valid
      Signed Statement, and may be registered again in a different
      Transparency Service.

   Verifier:  an entity that consumes Transparent Statements (a
      specialization of Signed Statement Consumer), verifying their
      proofs and inspecting their Statement payload, either before using
      corresponding Artifacts, or later to audit an Artifact's
      provenance on the supply chain.

4.  Definition of Transparency

   In this document, the definition of transparency is intended to build
   over abstract notions of Registry and Receipts.  Existing
   transparency systems such as Certificate Transparency are instances
   of this definition.

   A Signed Statement is an identifiable and non-repudiable Statement
   made by an Issuer.  The Issuer selects additional metadata and
   attaches a proof of endorsement (in most cases, a signature) using
   the identity key of the Issuer that binds the Statement and its
   metadata.  Signed Statements can be made transparent by attaching a
   proof of Registration by a Transparency Service, in the form of a
   Receipt that countersigns the Signed Statement and witnesses its
   inclusion in the Registry of a Transparency Service.  By extension,
   the document may say an Artifact (e.g., a firmware binary) is
   transparent if it comes with one or more Transparent Signed
   Statements from its author or owner, though the context should make
   it clear what type of Signed Statements is expected for a given
   Artifact.

   Transparency does not prevent dishonest or compromised Issuers, but
   it holds them accountable: any Artifact that may be used to target a
   particular user that checks for Receipts must have been recorded in
   the tamper-proof Registry, and will be subject to scrutiny and
   auditing by other parties.

   Transparency is implemented by a Registry that provides a consistent,
   append-only, cryptographically verifiable, publicly available record
   of entries.  Implementations of Transparency Services may protect
   their Registry using a combination of trusted hardware, replication
   and consensus protocols, and cryptographic evidence.  A Receipt is an
   offline, universally-verifiable proof that an entry is recorded in
   the Registry.  Receipts do not expire, but it is possible to append
   new entries (more recent Signed Statements) that subsume older
   entries (less recent Signed Statements).

   Anyone with access to the Registry can independently verify its
   consistency and review the complete list of Transparent Statements
   registered by each Issuer.  However, the Registries of separate
   Transparency Services are generally disjoint, though it is possible
   to take a Transparent Statement from one Registry and register it
   again on another (if its policy allows it), so the authorization of
   the Issuer and of the Registry by the Verifier of the Receipt are
   generally independent.

   Reputable Issuers are thus incentivized to carefully review their
   Statements before signing them to produce Signed Statements.
   Similarly, reputable Transparency Services are incentivized to secure
   their Registry, as any inconsistency can easily be pinpointed by any
   Auditor with read access to the Registry.  Some Registry formats may
   also support consistency auditing (Section 5.2.3.2) through Receipts,
   that is, given two valid Receipts the Transparency Service may be
   asked to produce a cryptographic proof that they are consistent.
   Failure to produce this proof can indicate that the Transparency
   Services operator misbehaved.

   The SCITT architecture consists of a very loose federation of
   Transparency Services, and a set of common formats and protocols for
   issuing and registering Signed Statements, and auditing Transparent
   Statements.

   In order to accommodate as many Transparency Service implementations
   as possible, this document only specifies the format of Signed
   Statements (which must be used by all Issuers) and a very thin
   wrapper format for Receipts, which specifies the Transparency Service
   identity and the agility parameters for the Merkle Tree Proof.  Most
   of the details of the Receipt's contents are specified in the COSE
   Signed Merkle Tree Proof document
   [I-D.draft-steele-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].

   This section describes at a high level, the three main roles and
   associated processes in SCITT: Issuers and the Signed Statement
   issuance process, Transparency Service and the Signed Statement
   Registration process, as well as Verifiers of the Transparent
   Statements and the Receipt validation process.

5.1.  Signed Statement Issuance and Registration

5.1.1.  Issuer Identity

   Before an Issuer is able to produce Signed Statements, it must first
   create its decentralized identifier [DID-CORE] (also known as a DID).
   A DID can be _resolved_ into a _key manifest_ (a list of public keys
   indexed by a _key identifier_) using many different DID methods.

   Issuers MAY choose the DID method they prefer, but with no guarantee
   that all Transparency Services will be able to register their Signed
   Statements.  To facilitate interoperability, all Transparency Service
   implementations MUST support the did:web method [DID-WEB].  For
   instance, if the Issuer publishes its manifest at
   https://sample.issuer/user/alice/did.json, the DID of the Issuer is
   did:web:sample.issuer:user:alice.

   Issuers SHOULD use consistent decentralized identifiers for all their
   Statements about Artifacts, to simplify authorization by Verifiers
   and auditing.  If an issuer uses multiple DIDs (for instance, because
   their clients support different resolution methods), they MUST ensure
   that statements signed under each DID are consistent.

   Issuers MAY update their DID Document at any time, for instance to
   refresh their signing keys or algorithms, but they SHOULD NOT remove
   or change any of their previous keys unless they intend to revoke all
   Signed Statements that are registered as Transparent Statements
   issued with those keys.

   The Issuer's DID appears in the protected header of Signed
   Statements' Envelopes, while the version of the key from the DID
   Document used to sign the Signed Statement is written in the kid
   header.

   kid MUST either be an absolute URL, or a relative URL.  Relative URL
   MUST be relative to an iss value.  When relative URL is used, iss
   MUST also be present in the protected header.

   Resolving kid MUST return an identity document of a registered
   content type (a set of public keys).  In the case of kid being an
   absolute DID URL, the identity document is called a DID Document, and
   is expected ot have content type application/did+json.

   To dereference a DID URL, it first MUST be resolved.  After that the
   fragment is processed according to the media type.

   For example, when resolving did:example:123#key-42, first, the
   identity document for did:example:123 is resolved as content type
   application/did+json, next, the fragment #key-42 is dereferenced to a
   verification method that contains a publicKeyJwk property.

   The content type of publicKeyJwk is expected to be application/
   jwk+json.

   The details of both DID resolution and DID dereferencing are out of
   scope for this document.

   The iss or kid, might not be DID URLs, however the following
   interfaces MUST be satisfied in order to ensure issuer identity
   documents, and associated keys are discoverable in a consistent
   manner.

5.1.1.1.  Resolving Identity Documents

   The value of id might be found the iss or sub claims if they are
   present in the protected header or payload.

   resolve = (id: string, accept: \
     content_type = 'application/did+json') =>
     idDocument (of content type application/did+json)

   For example:

   did:example:123

   Might resolve to:

   {
     "id": "did:example:123",
     "verificationMethod": [{
       "id": "#key-42",
       "type": "JsonWebkey",
       "controller": "did:example:123",
       "publicKeyJwk": {
         "kty": "EC",
         "crv": "P-384",
         "alg": "ES384",
         "x": "LCeAt2sW36j94wuFP0gN...Ler3cKFBCaAHY1svmbPV69bP3RH",
         "y": "zz2SkcOGYM6PbYlw19tc...rd8QWykAprstPdxx4U0uScvDcYd"
       }
     }]
   }

   Editor note, we might wish to eliminate this intermediate identity
   document content type, by treating it as an alterative encoding of
   application/jwk-set+json or application/cose-key-set.

   However, there is no media type fragment processing directive that
   would enable dereferencing the known key set content types, listed
   above.

5.1.1.1.1.  Comment on OIDC

   For well known token types, such as id_token or access_token.

   iss MUST be a URL, and it MUST have keys discoverable in the
   following way:

   iss can be used to build a .well-known URL to discovery the issuer's
   configuration.

   For example, iss contoso.example will have the following open id
   connect configuration URL.

   https://contoso.example/.well-known/openid-configuration.

   This URL will resolve to a JSON document which contains the property:

   jwks_uri, for example https://contoso.example/.well-known/jwks.json

   This URL will resolve to a JSON document of content type application/
   jwk-set+json, which will contain specific keys... for example:

   {
     "keys": [
       {
         "alg": "RS256",
         "kty": "RSA",
         "use": "sig",
         "n": "wW9TkSbcn5FV3iUJ-812sqTvwT...YzXrnMZ7WgbMPXmHU8i4z04zw",
         "e": "AQAB",
         "kid": "NTBGNTJEMDc3RUE3RUVEOTM4NDcEFDNzEyOTY5NDNGOUQ4OEU5OA",
         "x5t": "NTBGNTJEMDc3RUE3RUVEOTM4NDcEFDNzEyOTY5NDNGOUQ4OEU5OA",
         "x5c": [
           "MIIDCzCCAfOgAwIBAgIPng0XRWwsd...f5GOGwJS+u/nSYvqCFt57+g3R+"
         ]
       },
       {
         "alg": "RS256",
         "kty": "RSA",
         "use": "sig",
         "n": "ylgVZbNR4nlsU_AbU8Zd7ZhVfm...fo5BLa3_YLWazqcpWRXn9QEDWw",
         "e": "AQAB",
         "kid": "aMIKy_brQk3nLd0PKd9ln",
         "x5t": "-xcTyx47q3ddycG7LtE6QCcETbs",
         "x5c": [
           "MIIC/TCCAeWgAwIBAgIJH62ygzAPG...xCxmHAbK+KdTka/Yg2MadFZdA=="
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

   If SCITT wanted to be interoperable with OIDC, we would define key
   dereferencing in a way that was compatible with how OIDC handles it
   today.

5.1.1.2.  Dereferencing Public Keys

   kid is always present in the protected header.

   If iss is also present, kid MUST be a relative URL to iss, otherwise
   kid MUST be an absolute URL that starts with iss.

   id = kid if iss is undefined, or iss + # + kid when iss is defined.

   See also draft-ietf-cose-cwt-claims-in-headers
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cose-cwt-claims-in-
   headers/).

   dereference = (id: string, accept: \
     content_type = 'application/jwk+json') =>
     publicKeyJwk (of content type application/jwk+json)

   For example, when DIDs are used:

   did:example:123#key-42

   Might dereference to:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-384",
     "alg": "ES384",
     "x": "LCeAt2sW36j94wuFP0gNEIHDzqR6Nh...er3cKFBCaAHY1svmbPV69bP3RH",
     "y": "zz2SkcOGYM6PbYlw19tcbpzo6bEMYH...d8QWykAprstPdxx4U0uScvDcYd"
   }

5.1.2.  Support for Multiple Artifacts

   Many Issuers produce Signed Statements about various Artifacts under
   the same Identity.  Issuers and Verifiers must be able to recognize
   the Artifact to which the statements pertain by looking at the Signed
   Statement.  This information is stored in the Subject header of the
   Envelope.  Issuers MAY use different signing keys (identified by kid
   in the resolved key manifest) for different Artifacts, or sign all
   Signed Statements under the same key.

5.1.3.  Registration Policy Metadata

   SCITT payloads are opaque to Transparency Services, so Registration
   Policy decisions can only be based on interpretation of information
   in the Envelope.

   The small mandatory set of metadata in the envelope of a Signed
   Statement is neither intended nor sufficient to express the
   information required for the processing of Registration Policies in a
   Transparency Service.

   For example, a Registry may only allow a Signed Statement to be
   registered if it was signed very recently, or may reject a Signed
   Statement if it arrives out of order in some sequenced protocol.

   Any metadata meant to be interpreted by the Transparency Service
   during Registration Policy evaluation, SHOULD be added to the
   reg_info header, unless the data is private (in which case, it MAY be
   sent to the Transparency Service as an additional input during
   registration).

   While the header MUST be present in all Signed Statements, all
   attributes are optional and so the map MAY be empty.

5.2.  Transparency Service

   The role of Transparency Service can be decomposed into several major
   functions.  The most important is maintaining a Registry, the
   verifiable data structure that records Signed Statements, and
   enforcing a Registration Policy.  It also maintains a service key,
   which is used to endorse the state of the Registry in Receipts.  All
   Transparency Services MUST expose standard endpoints for Registration
   of Signed Statements and Receipt issuance, which is described in
   Section 8.1.  Each Transparency Service also defines its own
   Registration Policies, which MUST apply to all entries in the
   Registry.

   The combination of Registry, identity, Registration Policy
   evaluation, and Registration endpoint constitute the trusted part of
   the Transparency Service.  Each of these components MUST be carefully
   protected against both external attacks and internal misbehavior by
   some or all of the operators of the Transparency Service.  For
   instance, the code for policy evaluation, Registry extension and
   endorsement may be protected by running in a TEE; the Registry may be
   replicated and a consensus algorithm such as Practical Byzantine
   Fault Tolerance (pBFT [PBFT]) may be used to protect against
   malicious or vulnerable replicas; threshold signatures may be use to
   protect the service key, etc.

   Beyond the trusted components, Transparency Services may operate
   additional endpoints for auditing, for instance to query for the
   history of Signed Statements registered by a given Issuer via a
   certain Subject.  Implementations of Transparency Services SHOULD
   avoid using the service identity and extending the Registry in
   auditing endpoints, except if it is necessary to compute a Registry
   consistency proofs.  Other evidence to support the correctness and
   completeness of the audit response MUST be computed from the
   Registry.

5.2.1.  Service Identity, Remote Attestation, and Keying

   Every Transparency Service MUST have a public service identity,
   associated with public/private key pairs for signing on behalf of the
   service.  In particular, this identity must be known by Verifiers
   when validating a Receipt.

   This identity MUST be stable for the lifetime of the service, so that
   all Receipts remain valid and consistent.  The Transparency Service
   operator MAY use a distributed identifier as their public service
   identity if they wish to rotate their keys, if the Registry algorithm
   they use for their Receipt supports it.  Other types of cryptographic
   identities, such as parameters for non-interactive zero-knowledge
   proof systems, may also be used in the future.

   A Transparency Service MAY provide extra evidence that it is securely
   implemented and operated, enabling remote authentication of the
   hardware platforms and/or software TCB that run the Transparency
   Service.  If present, this additional evidence MUST be recorded in
   the Registry and presented on demand to Verifiers and Auditors.
   Examples for Statements that can improve trustworthy assessments of
   Transparency Services are RATS Conceptual Messages, such as Evidence,
   Endorsements, or corresponding Attestation Results (see [RFC9334].

   For example, consider a Transparency Service implemented using a set
   of replicas, each running within its own hardware-protected trusted
   execution environments (TEEs).  Each replica MAY provide a recent
   attestation report for its TEE, binding their hardware platform to
   the software that runs the Transparency Service, the long-term public
   key of the service, and the key used by the replica for signing
   Receipts.  This attestation evidence can be supplemented with
   Receipts for the software and configuration of the service, as
   measured in its attestation report.

5.2.2.  Registration Policies

   A Transparency Service that accepts to register any valid Signed
   Statement offered by anonymous Issuers would only provide limited
   value, or no value, to verifiers.  As a consequence, some form of
   authorization is needed prior to registration of Signed Statements to
   ensure completeness of audit.  More advanced use case will rely on
   the Transparency Service performing additional domain-specific checks
   before a Signed Statement is accepted.  For example, some
   Transparency Services may validate the content of Signed Statements.

   We use the term "registration policies" to refer to the checks that
   are performed before a Signed Statement is registered given a set of
   input values.  This baseline specification leaves the implementation
   of the registration policy to the provider of the Transparency
   Services and its users.

   As a minimum we expect that a deployment authenticates the Issuer of
   the Signed Statement, which requires some form of trust anchor.  As
   defined in [RFC6024], "A trust anchor represents an authoritative
   entity via a public key and associated data.  The public key is used
   to verify digital signatures, and the associated data is used to
   constrain the types of information for which the trust anchor is
   authoritative."  The Trust Anchor may be a certificate, a raw public
   key or other structure, as appropriate.  It can be a non-root
   certificate when it is a certificate.

   A provider of a Transparency Service is, however, expected to
   indicate what registration policy is used in a given deployment and
   inform its users about changes to the registration policy.

5.2.3.  Registry Security Requirements

   There are many different candidate verifiable data structures that
   may be used to implement the Registry, such as chronological Merkle
   Trees, sparse/indexed Merkle Trees, full blockchains, and many other
   variants.  The Registry is only required to support concise Receipts
   (i.e., whose size grows at most logarithmically in the number of
   entries in the Registry) that can be encoded as a COSE Signed Merkle
   Tree Proof.

   It is possible to offer multiple signature algorithms for the COSE
   signature of receipts' Signed Merkle Tree, or to change the signing
   algorithm at later points.  However, the Merkle Tree algorithm
   (including its internal hash function) cannot easily be changed
   without breaking the consistency of the Registry.  It is possible to
   maintain separate Registries for each algorithm in parallel but the
   Transparency Service is then responsible for proving their mutual
   consistency.

5.2.3.1.  Finality

   A Registry is append-only: once a Signed Statement is registered and
   becomes a Transparent Statement, it cannot be modified, deleted, or
   moved.  In particular, once a Receipt is returned for a given Signed
   Statement, the registered Signed Statement and any preceding entry in
   the Registry become immutable, and the Receipt provides universally-
   verifiable evidence of this property.

5.2.3.2.  Consistency

   There is no fork in the Registry: everyone with access to its
   contents sees the same sequence of entries, and can check its
   consistency with any Receipts they have collected.  Transparency
   Service implementations MAY provide a mechanism to verify that the
   state of the Registry encoded in an old Receipt is consistent with
   the current Registry state.

5.2.3.3.  Replayability and Auditing

   Everyone with access to the Registry can check the correctness of its
   contents.  In particular,

   *  the Transparency Service defines and enforces deterministic
      Registration Policies that can be re-evaluated based solely on the
      contents of the Registry at the time of Registration, and must
      then yield the same result.

   *  the ordering of entries, their cryptographic contents, and the
      Registry governance may be non-deterministic, but they must be
      verifiable.

   *  a Transparency Service MAY store evidence about the resolution of
      DIDs into DID Documents.

   *  a Transparency Service MAY additionally support verifiability of
      client authentication and access control.

5.2.3.4.  Governance and Bootstrapping

   Transparency Services MAY document their governance rules and
   procedures for operating the Registry and updating its code (e.g.,
   relying on Transparent Statements about code updates, secured on the
   Registry itself, or on some auxiliary Transparency Service).
   Governance procedures, their auditing, and their transparency are
   implementation specific.

   *  Governance may be based on a consortium of members that are
      jointly responsible for the Transparency Services, or automated
      based on the contents of an auxiliary governance Transparency
      Service.

   *  Governance typically involves additional records in the Registry
      to enable its auditing.  Hence, the Registry may contain both
      Transparent Statements and governance entries.

   *  Issuers, Verifiers, and third-party Auditors may review the
      Transparency Service governance before trusting the service, or on
      a regular basis.

5.3.  Verifying Transparent Statements

   For a given Transparent Statement, Verifiers take as trusted inputs:

   1.  the distributed identifier of the Issuer (or its resolved key
       manifest)

   2.  the collection of Transparent Statements to which this Statement
       about the Artifact belongs (i.e., the CWT_Claims Subject)

   3.  the list of service identities of trusted Transparency Services

   When presented with a Transparent Statement for an Artifact,
   Consumers verify its Issuer identity, signature, and Receipt.  They
   may additionally apply a validation policy based on the protected
   headers present both in the Envelope, the Receipt, or the Statement
   itself, which may include security-critical or Artifact-specific
   details.

   Some Verifiers may systematically fetch all Transparent Statements
   from the Feed and assess them alongside the Transparent Statement
   they are verifying to ensure freshness, completeness of evidence, and
   the promise of non-equivocation.

   Some Verifiers may systematically resolve Issuer DIDs to fetch the
   latest corresponding DID documents.  This behavior strictly enforces
   the revocation of compromised keys: once the Issuer has updated its
   Statement to remove a key identifier, all Signed Statements include
   the corresponding kid will be rejected.  However, others may delegate
   DID resolution to a trusted third party and/or cache its results.

   Some Verifiers may decide to skip the DID-based signature
   verification, relying on the Transparency Service's Registration
   Policy and the scrutiny of other Verifiers.  Although this weakens
   their guarantees against key revocation, or against a corrupt
   Transparency Services, they can still keep the Receipt and blame the
   Issuer or the Transparency Services at a later point.

6.  Signed Statement Issuance, Registration, and Verification

   This section details the interoperability requirements for
   implementers of Signed Statements issuance and validation libraries,
   and of Transparency Services.

6.1.  Signed Statement Envelope

   Signed Statements are CBOR encoded [RFC8949] and protected by CBOR
   Object Signing and Encryption (COSE [RFC9052]).  Additionally, it
   contains at least one or more headers and a set of statements as its
   payload.  Although Issuers and other parties MAY attach unprotected
   headers to Signed Statements, Transparency Services and Verifiers
   MUST NOT rely on the presence or value of additional unprotected
   headers in Signed Statements during Registration and validation.

   All Signed Statements MUST include the following protected headers:

   *  algorithm (label: 1): Asymmetric signature algorithm used by the
      Issuer of a Signed Statement, as an integer.  For example, -35 is
      the registered algorithm identifier for ECDSA with SHA-384, see
      COSE Algorithms Registry [IANA.cose].

   *  Issuer (label: TBD, temporary: 391): DID (Decentralized Identifier
      [DID-CORE]) of the signer, as a string. did:web:example.com is an
      example of a DID.

   *  Subject (label: TBD, temporary: 392): The Subject to which the
      Statement refers, as a property of CTW_Clians, chosen by the
      Issuer.  (TODO: reconcile with CWT_Claims)

   *  Content type (label: 3): Media type of payload, as a string.  For
      example, application/spdx+json is the media type of SDPX in JSON
      encoding.

   *  Registration Policy info (label: TBD, temporary: 393): A map
      containing key/value pairs set by the Issuer which are sealed on
      Registration and non-opaque to the Transparency Service.  The key/
      value pair semantics are specified by each Issuer or are specific
      to the Issuer and Feed tuple.  Examples include: the sequence
      number of signed statements on a feed, Issuer metadata, or a
      reference to other transparent statements (e.g., augments,
      replaces, new-version, CPE-for).

   *  Key ID (label: 4): Key ID, as a bytestring.

   In CDDL [RFC8610] notation, a Signed_Statement is defined as follows:

   Signed_Statement = COSE_Sign1_Tagged

   COSE_Sign1_Tagged = #6.18(COSE_Sign1)

   COSE_Sign1 = [
     protected : bstr .cbor Protected_Header,
     unprotected : Unprotected_Header,
     payload : bstr,
     signature : bstr
   ]
   <!-- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cose-cwt-claims-in-headers/ -->
   <!-- https://www.iana.org/assignments/cwt/cwt.xhtml -->
   CWT_Claims = {
     1 => tstr; iss, the issuer that is making statements
     2 => tstr; sub, the subject about which the statements are made, throughout this spec, this is also called feed.
     * tstr => any
   }

   Reg_Info = {
     ? "register_by": uint .within (~time),
     ? "sequence_no": uint,
     ? "issuance_ts": uint .within (~time),
     ? "no_replay": null,
     * tstr => any
   }

   Protected_Header = {
     1 => int               ; algorithm identifier
     3 => tstr              ; payload type
     4 => bstr              ; Key ID
     13 => CWT_Claims       ; CBOR Web Token Registered Claims
     ; TBD, Labels are temporary
     393 => Reg_Info        ; Registration Policy info
   }

   Unprotected_Header = {
     ; TBD, Labels are temporary
     ? 394 => [+ Receipt]
   }

   There are many types of Statements (such as SBOMs, malware scans,
   audit reports, policy definitions) that Issuers may want to turn into
   Signed Statements.  An Issuer must first decide what Statements to
   include.  For a software supply chain, payloads describing the
   software artifacts may, for example, include

   *  JSON-SPDX

   *  CBOR-SPDX

   *  SWID

   *  CoSWID

   *  CycloneDX

   *  in-toto

   *  SLSA

   Once the Statement is serialized with the correct media-type/content-
   format, an Issuer should fill in the attributes for the Registration
   Policy information header.  From the Issuer's perspective, using
   attributes from named policies ensures that the Signed Statement may
   only be registered on Transparency Services that implement the
   associated policy.  For instance, if a Signed Statement is frequently
   updated, and it is important for Verifiers to always consider the
   latest version, Issuers SHOULD use the sequence_no or issuer_ts
   attributes.

6.2.  Registering Signed Statements

   The same Signed Statement may be independently registered by multiple
   Transparency Services.  To register a Signed Statement, the
   Transparency Service performs the following steps:

   1.  *Issuer Key Discovery:* The Transparency Service MUST perform DID
       resolution of the Issuer's key and store evidence of the lookup.
       This step may require that the service retrieves the Issuer DID
       in real-time, or relies on retrieving cached resolution.

   2.  *Signature verification:* The Transparency Service MUST verify
       the signature of the Signed Statement, as described in RFC 9360,
       using the signature algorithm and verification key of the Issuer
       DID document.

   3.  *Signed Statement validation:* The Transparency Service MUST
       check that the Signed Statement includes a Statement payload and
       the protected headers listed above.  The Transparency Service MAY
       additionally verify the Statement payload format and content.

   4.  *Apply Registration Policy:* For named policies, the Transparency
       Service MUST check that the required Registration info attributes
       are present in the headers and apply the check described in
       Table 1.  A Transparency Service MUST reject Signed Statements
       that contain an attribute used for a named policy that is not
       enforced by the service.  Custom Signed Statements are evaluated
       given the current Registry state and the entire Envelope, and may
       use information contained in the attributes of named policies.

   5.  Register the Signed Statement to the append-only log

   6.  Return the Transparent Statement, which includes the Receipt
       Details about generating Receipts are described in Section 6.3.

   The last two steps may be shared between a batch of Signed Statements
   recorded in the Registry.

   A Transparency Service MUST ensure that a Signed Statement is
   registered before releasing its Receipt, so that it can always back
   up the Receipt by releasing the corresponding entry (the now
   Transparent Statement) in the Registry.  Conversely, the Transparency
   Service MAY re-issue Receipts for the Registry content, for instance
   after a transient fault during Signed Statement registration.

6.3.  Transparent Statements and Receipts

   When a Signed Statement is registered by a TS a Transparent Statement
   is created.  This Transparent Statement consists of the Signed
   Statement and a Receipt.  Receipts are based on COSE Signed Merkle
   Tree Proofs ([I-D.draft-steele-cose-merkle-tree-proofs]) with an
   additional wrapper structure that adds the following information:

   *  version: Receipt version number; MUST be set to 0 for
      implementation of this document.

   *  ts_identifier: The DID of the Transparency Service that issued the
      Receipt.  Verifiers MAY use this DID as a key discovery mechanism
      to verify the Receipt; in this case the verification is the same
      as for Signed Statement and the signer MAY include the kid header
      parameter.  Verifiers MUST support the did:web method, all other
      methods are optional.

   We also introduce the following requirements for the COSE signature
   of the Merkle Root:

   *  The SCITT version header MUST be included and its value match the
      version field of the Receipt structure.

   *  The DID of issuer header (like in Signed Statements) MUST be
      included and its value match the ts_identifier field of the
      Receipt structure.

   *  TS MAY include the Registration policy info header to indicate to
      verifiers what policies have been applied at the registration of
      this Statement.

   *  Since [I-D.draft-steele-cose-merkle-tree-proofs] uses optional
      headers, the crit header (id: 2) MUST be included and all SCITT-
      specific headers (version, DID of TS and Registration Policy) MUST
      be marked critical.

   The TS may include the registration time to help verifiers decide
   about the trustworthiness of the Transparent Statement.  The
   registration time is defined as the timestamp at which the TS has
   added this Signed Statement to its Registry.

   Receipt = [
       version: int,
       ts_identifier: tstr,
       proof: SignedMerkleTreeProof
   ]

   ; Additional protected headers
   ; in the COSE signed_tree_root of the SignedMerkleTreeProof
   Protected_Header = {
     390 => int         ; SCITT Receipt Version
     394 => tstr        ; DID of Transparency Service (required)
     ? 395 => Reg_info  ; Registration policy information (optional)

     ; Other COSE Signed Merkle Tree headers
     ; (e.g. tree algorithm, tree size)

     ; Additional standard COSE headers
     2 => [+ label]            ; Critical headers
     ? 4 => bstr               ; Key ID (optional)
     ? 33 => COSE_X509         ; X.509 chain (optional)
   }

   ; Details of the registration info, as provided by the TS
   RegistrationInfo = {
     ? "registration_time": uint .within (~time),
     * tstr => any
   }

6.4.  Signed Statement Issuance

   There are many types of Statements (such as SBOMs, malware scans,
   audit reports, policy definitions) that Issuers may want to turn into
   Signed Statements.  An Issuer must first decide on a suitable format
   to serialize the Statement payload.  For a software supply chain,
   payloads describing the software artifacts may, for example, include

   *  JSON-SPDX

   *  CBOR-SPDX

   *  SWID

   *  CoSWID

   *  CycloneDX

   *  in-toto

   *  SLSA

   Once the Statement is serialized with the correct media-type/content-
   format, an Issuer MUST fill in the attributes for the Registration
   Policy information header.  From the Issuer's perspective, using
   attributes from named policies ensures that the Signed Statement may
   only be registered on Transparency Services that implement the
   associated policy.  For instance, if a Signed Statement is frequently
   updated, and it is important for Verifiers to always consider the
   latest version, Issuers may use the sequence_no or issuer_ts
   attributes.

   Once all the Envelope headers are set, an Issuer MUST use a standard
   COSE implementation to produce an appropriately serialized Signed
   Statement (the SCITT tag of COSE_Sign1_Tagged is outside the scope of
   COSE, and used to indicate that a signed object is a Signed
   Statement).

6.5.  Registering Signed Statements

   The same Signed Statement may be independently registered in multiple
   Transparency Services.  To register a Signed Statement, the service
   performs the following steps:

   1.  *Client authentication:* This is implementation-specific and MAY
       be unrelated to the Issuer identity.  Signed Statements may be
       registered by a different party than their Issuer.

   2.  *Issuer identification:* The Transparency Service MUST store
       evidence of the DID resolution for the Issuer protected header of
       the Envelope and the resolved key manifest at the time of
       Registration for auditing.  This MAY require that the service
       resolves the Issuer DID and record the resulting document, or
       rely on a cache of recent resolutions.

   3.  *Envelope signature verification:* As described in COSE
       signature, using the signature algorithm and verification key of
       the Issuer DID document

   4.  *Envelope validation:* The service MUST check that the Envelope
       includes a Statement payload and the protected headers listed
       above The service MAY additionally verify the Statement payload
       format and content.

   5.  *Apply Registration Policy:* for named policies, the Transparency
       Service must check that the required Registration info attributes
       are present in the Envelope and apply the check described in
       Table 1.  A Transparency Service MUST reject Signed Statements
       that contain an attribute used for a named policy that is not
       enforced by the service.  Custom Signed Statements are evaluated
       given the current Registry state and the entire Envelope, and MAY
       use information contained in the attributes of named policies.

   6.  Commit (register) the new Signed Statement to the Registry

   7.  Sign and return the Receipt

   The last two steps MAY be shared between a batch of Signed Statements
   recorded in the Registry.

   A Transparency Service MUST ensure that a Signed Statement is
   registered before releasing its Receipt, so that it can always back
   up the Receipt by releasing the corresponding entry (the now
   Transparent Statement) in the Registry.  Conversely, the service MAY
   re-issue Receipts for the Registry content, for instance after a
   transient fault during Signed Statement Registration.

6.6.  Validation of Transparent Statements

   The high-level validation algorithm is described in Section 5.3; the
   algorithm-specific details of checking Receipts are covered in
   [I-D.draft-steele-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].

   Before checking a Transparent Statement, the Verifier must be
   configured with one or more identities of trusted Transparency
   Services.  If more than one service is configured, the Verifier MUST
   return which service the Transparent Statement is registered on.

   In some scenarios, the Verifier already expects a specific Issuer and
   Subject for the Transparent Statement, while in other cases they are
   not known in advance and can be an output of validation.  Verifiers
   MAY be configured to re-verify the Issuer's signature locally, but
   this requires a fresh resolution of the Issuer's DID, which MAY fail
   if the DID Document is not available or if the statement's signing
   key has been revoked.  Otherwise, the Verifier trusts the validation
   done by the Transparency Service during Registration.

   Some Verifiers MAY decide to locally re-apply some or all of the
   Registration Policies, if they have limited trust in the Transparency
   Services.  In addition, Verifiers MAY apply arbitrary validation
   policies after the signature and Receipt have been checked.  Such
   policies may use as input all information in the Envelope, the
   Receipt, and the Statement payload, as well as any local state.

   Verifiers MAY offer options to store or share the Receipt of the
   Transparent Statement for auditing the Transparency Services in case
   a dispute arises.

7.  Federation

   This topic is still under discussion, see issue 79
   (https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/
   issues/79)

   Multiple, independently-operated Transparency Services can help
   secure distributed supply chains, without the need for a single,
   centralized service trusted by all parties.  For example, multiple
   Transparency Service instances may be governed and operated by
   different organizations that do not trust one another.

   This may involve registering the same Signed Statements at different
   Transparency Services, each with their own purpose and Registration
   Policy.  This may also involve attaching multiple Receipts to the
   same Signed Statements, each Receipt endorsing the Issuer signature
   and a subset of prior Receipts, and each Transparency Service
   verifying prior Receipts as part of their Registration Policy.

   For example, a supplier's Transparency Service may provide a
   complete, authoritative Registry for some kind of Signed Statements,
   whereas a Consumer's Transparency Service may collect different kinds
   of Signed Statements to ensure complete auditing for a specific use
   case, and possibly require additional reviews before registering some
   of these Signed Statements.

8.  Transparency Service API

8.1.  Messages

   All messages are sent as HTTP GET or POST requests.

   If the Transparency Service cannot process a client's request, it
   MUST return an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code, and the body MAY contain
   a JSON problem details object ([RFC7807]) with the following fields:

   *  type: A URI reference identifying the problem.  To facilitate
      automated response to errors, this document defines a set of
      standard tokens for use in the type field within the URN namespace
      of: "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error:".

   *  detail: A human-readable string describing the error that
      prevented the Transparency Service from processing the request,
      ideally with sufficient detail to enable the error to be
      rectified.

   Error responses MUST be sent with the Content-Type: application/
   problem+json HTTP header.

   As an example, submitting a Signed Statement with an unsupported
   signature algorithm would return a 400 Bad Request status code and
   the following body:

   {
     "type": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error:badSignatureAlgorithm",
     "detail": "The Statement was signed with an unsupported algorithm"
   }

   Most error types are specific to the type of request and are defined
   in the respective subsections below.  The one exception is the
   "malformed" error type, which indicates that the Transparency Service
   could not parse the client's request because it did not comply with
   this document:

   *  Error code: malformed (The request could not be parsed).

   Clients MUST treat 500 and 503 HTTP status code responses as
   transient failures and MAY retry the same request without
   modification at a later date.  Note that in the case of a 503
   response, the Transparency Service MAY include a Retry-After header
   field per [RFC7231] in order to request a minimum time for the client
   to wait before retrying the request.  In the absence of this header
   field, this document does not specify a minimum.

8.1.1.  Register Signed Statement

8.1.1.1.  Request

   POST <Base URL>/entries

   Headers:

   *  Content-Type: application/cose

   Body: SCITT COSE_Sign1 message

8.1.1.2.  Response

   One of the following:

   *  Status 201 - Registration is successful.

      -  Header Location: <Base URL>/entries/<Entry ID>

      -  Header Content-Type: application/json

      -  Body { "entryId": "<Entry ID"> }

   *  Status 202 - Registration is running.

      -  Header Location: <Base URL>/operations/<Operation ID>

      -  Header Content-Type: application/json

      -  (Optional) Header: Retry-After: <seconds>

      -  Body { "operationId": "<Operation ID>", "status": "running" }

   *  Status 400 - Registration was unsuccessful due to invalid input.

      -  Error code badSignatureAlgorithm

      -  TBD: more error codes to be defined, see #17
         (https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-
         architecture/issues/17)

   If HTTP code 202 is returned, then clients must wait until
   Registration succeeded or failed by polling the Registration status
   using the Operation ID returned in the response.  Clients MUST NOT
   report registration is complete until an HTTP code 202 response has
   been received.  A time out of the Client MUST be treated as a
   registration failure, even though the transparency service may
   eventually complete the registration.

8.1.2.  Retrieve Operation Status

8.1.2.1.  Request

   GET <Base URL>/operations/<Operation ID>

8.1.2.2.  Response

   One of the following:

   *  Status 200 - Registration is running

      -  Header: Content-Type: application/json

      -  (Optional) Header: Retry-After: <seconds>

      -  Body: { "operationId": "<Operation ID>", "status": "running" }

   *  Status 200 - Registration was successful

      -  Header: Location: <Base URL>/entries/<Entry ID>

      -  Header: Content-Type: application/json

      -  Body: { "operationId": "<Operation ID>", "status": "succeeded",
         "entryId": "<Entry ID>" }

   *  Status 200 - Registration failed

      -  Header Content-Type: application/json

      -  Body: { "operationId": "<Operation ID>", "status": "failed",
         "error": { "type": "<type>", "detail": "<detail>" } }

      -  Error code: badSignatureAlgorithm

      -  TODO: more error codes to be defined, see #17
         (https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-
         architecture/issues/17)

   *  Status 404 - Unknown Operation ID

      -  Error code: operationNotFound

      -  This can happen if the operation ID has expired and been
         deleted.

   If an operation failed, then error details MUST be embedded as a JSON
   problem details object in the "error" field.

   If an operation ID is invalid (i.e., it does not correspond to any
   submit operation), a service may return either a 404 or a running
   status.  This is because differentiating between the two may not be
   possible in an eventually consistent system.

8.1.3.  Retrieve Signed Statement

8.1.3.1.  Request

   GET <Base URL>/entries/<Entry ID>

   Query parameters:

   *  (Optional) embedReceipt=true

   If the query parameter embedReceipt=true is provided, then the Signed
   Statement is returned with the corresponding Registration Receipt
   embedded in the COSE unprotected header.

8.1.3.2.  Response

   One of the following:

   *  Status 200.

      -  Header: Content-Type: application/cose

      -  Body: COSE_Sign1

   *  Status 404 - Entry not found.

      -  Error code: entryNotFound

8.1.4.  Retrieve Registration Receipt

8.1.4.1.  Request

   GET <Base URL>/entries/<Entry ID>/receipt

8.1.4.2.  Response

   One of the following:

   *  Status 200.

      -  Header: Content-Type: application/cbor

      -  Body: SCITT_Receipt

   *  Status 404 - Entry not found.

      -  Error code: entryNotFound

   The retrieved Receipt may be embedded in the corresponding COSE_Sign1
   document in the unprotected header.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   Unless advertised by a Transparency Service, every Issuer must treat
   Signed Statements it registered (rendering them Transparent
   Statements) as public.  In particular, Signed Statements' Envelopes
   and Statement payload MUST NOT carry any private information in
   plaintext.

10.  Security Considerations

   On its own, verifying a Transparent Statement does not guarantee that
   its Envelope or contents are trustworthy---just that they have been
   signed by the apparent Issuer and counter-signed by the Transparency
   Service.  If the Verifier trusts the Issuer, it can infer that an
   Issuer's Signed Statement was issued with this Envelope and contents,
   which may be interpreted as the Issuer saying the Artifact is fit for
   its intended purpose.  If the Verifier trusts the Transparency
   Service, it can independently infer that the Signed Statement passed
   the Transparency Service Registration Policy and that has been
   persisted in the Registry.  Unless advertised in the Transparency
   Service Registration Policy, the Verifier cannot assume that the
   ordering of Signed Statements in the Registry matches the ordering of
   their issuance.

   Similarly, the fact that an Issuer can be held accountable for its
   Transparent Statements does not on its own provide any mitigation or
   remediation mechanism in case one of these Transparent Statements
   turned out to be misleading or malicious---just that signed evidence
   will be available to support them.

   Issuers MUST ensure that the Statement payloads in their Signed
   Statements are correct and unambiguous, for example by avoiding ill-
   defined or ambiguous formats that may cause Verifiers to interpret
   the Signed Statement as valid for some other purpose.

   Issuers and Transparency Services MUST carefully protect their
   private signing keys and avoid these keys being used for any purpose
   not described in this architecture document.  In cases where key re-
   use is unavoidable, keys MUST NOT sign any other message that may be
   verified as an Envelope as part of a Signed Statement.

10.1.  Threat Model

   The document provides a generic threat model for SCITT, describing
   its residual security properties when some of its actors (identity
   providers, Issuers, Transparency Services, and Auditors) are corrupt
   or compromised.

   This model may need to be refined to account for specific supply
   chains and use cases.

10.1.1.  Signed Statement Authentication and Transparency

   SCITT primarily supports checking of Signed Statement authenticity,
   both from the Issuer (authentication) and from the Transparency
   Service (transparency).  These guarantees are meant to hold for
   extensive periods of time, possibly decades.

   It can never be assumed that some Issuers and some Transparency
   Services will not be corrupt.

   SCITT entities explicitly trust one another on the basis of their
   long-term identity, which maps to shorter-lived cryptographic
   credentials.  Hence, a Verifier would usually validate a Transparent
   Statement originating from a given Issuer, registered at a given
   Transparency Service (both identified in the Verifier's local
   authorization policy) and would not depend on any other Issuer or
   Transparency Services.

   Authorized supply chain actors (Issuers) cannot be stopped from
   producing Signed Statements including false assertions in their
   Statement payload (either by mistake or by corruption), but these
   Issuers can made accountable by ensuring their Signed Statements are
   systematically registered at a trustworthy Transparency Service.

   Similarly, providing strong residual guarantees against faulty/
   corrupt Transparency Services is a SCITT design goal.  Preventing a
   Transparency Service from registering Signed Statements that do not
   meet its stated Registration Policy, or to issue Receipts that are
   not consistent with their append-only Log is not possible.  In
   contrast Transparency Services can be hold accountable and they can
   be called out by any Auditor that replays their Registry against any
   contested Receipt.  Note that the SCITT Architecture does not require
   trust in a single centralized Transparency Service: different actors
   may rely on different Transparency Services, each registering a
   subset of Signed Statements subject to their own policy.

   In both cases, the SCITT Architecture provides generic, universally-
   verifiable cryptographic proof to individually blame Issuers or the
   Transparency Service.  On one hand, this enables valid actors to
   detect and disambiguate malicious actors who issue contradictory
   Signed Statements to different entities (Verifiers, Auditors,
   Issuers), otherwise known as 'equivocation'.  On the other hand,
   their liability and the resulting damage to their reputation are
   application specific, and out of scope of the SCITT Architecture.

   Verifiers and Auditors need not be trusted by other actors.  In
   particular, so long as actors maintain proper control of their
   signing keys and identity infrastructure they cannot "frame" an
   Issuer or a Transparency Service for Signed Statements they did not
   issue or register.

10.1.1.1.  Append-only Log

   If a Transparency Service is honest, then a Transparent Statement
   including a correct Receipt ensures that the associated Signed
   Statement passed its Registration Policy and was recorded
   appropriately.

   Conversely, a corrupt Transparency Service may

   1.  refuse or delay the Registration of Signed Statements,

   2.  register Signed Statements that do not pass its Registration
       Policy (e.g., Signed Statement with Issuer identities and
       signatures that do not verify),

   3.  issue verifiable Receipts for Signed Statements that do not match
       its Registry, or

   4.  refuse access to its Registry (e.g., to Auditors, possibly after
       storage loss).

   An Auditor granted (partial) access to a Registry and to a collection
   of disputed Receipts will be able to replay it, detect any invalid
   Registration (2) or incorrect Receipt in this collection (3), and
   blame the Transparency Service for them.  This ensures any Verifier
   that trusts at least one such Auditor that (2,3) will be blamed to
   the Transparency Service.

   Due to the operational challenge of maintaining a globally consistent
   append-only Log, some Transparency Services may provide limited
   support for historical queries on the Signed Statements they have
   registered, and accept the risk of being blamed for inconsistent
   Registration or Issuer equivocation.

   Verifiers and Auditors may also witness (1,4) but may not be able to
   collect verifiable evidence for it.

10.1.1.2.  Availability of Transparent Signed Statement

   Networking and Storage are trusted only for availability.

   Auditing may involve access to data beyond what is persisted in the
   Transparency Services.  For example, the registered Transparency
   Service may include only the hash of a detailed SBOM, which may limit
   the scope of auditing.

   Resistance to denial-of-service is implementation specific.

   Actors may want to independently keep their own record of the Signed
   Statements they issue, endorse, verify, or audit.

10.1.2.  Confidentiality and Privacy

   According to Zero Trust Principles any location in a network is never
   trusted.  All contents exchanged between actors is protected using
   secure authenticated channels (e.g., TLS) but, as usual, this may not
   exclude network traffic analysis.

10.1.2.1.  Signed Statements and Their Registration

   The Transparency Service is trusted with the confidentiality of the
   Signed Statements presented for Registration.  Some Transparency
   Services may publish every Signed Statement in their logs, to
   facilitate their dissemination and auditing.  Others may just return
   Receipts to clients that present Singed Statements for Registration,
   and disclose the Append-only Log only to Auditors trusted with the
   confidentiality of its contents.

   A collection of Signed Statements must not leak information about the
   contents of other Signed Statements registered on the Transparency
   Service.

   Nonetheless, Issuers must carefully review the inclusion of private/
   confidential materials in their Statements.  For example, Issuers
   must remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as clear text
   in the statement.  Alternatively, Issuers may include opaque
   cryptographic statements, such as hashes.

10.1.2.2.  Queries to the Registry

   The confidentiality of queries is implementation-specific, and
   generally not guaranteed.  For example, while offline Envelope
   validation of Signed Statements is private, a Transparency Service
   may monitor which of its Transparent Statements are being verified
   from lookups to ensure their freshness.

10.1.3.  Cryptographic Assumptions

   SCITT relies on standard cryptographic security for signing schemes
   (EUF-CMA: for a given key, given the public key and any number of
   signed messages, an attacker cannot forge a valid signature for any
   other message) and for Receipts schemes (log collision-resistance:
   for a given commitment such as a Merkle-tree root, there is a unique
   log such that any valid path authenticates a Signed Statement in this
   log.)

   The SCITT Architecture supports cryptographic agility: the actors
   depend only on the subset of signing and Receipt schemes they trust.
   This enables the gradual transition to stronger algorithms, including
   e.g. post-quantum signature algorithms.

10.1.4.  Transparency Service Clients

   Trust in clients that submit Signed Statements for Registration is
   implementation-specific.  Hence, an attacker may attempt to register
   any Signed Statement it has obtained, at any Transparency Service
   that accepts them, possibly multiple times and out of order.  This
   may be mitigated by a Transparency Service that enforces restrictive
   access control and Registration Policies.

10.1.5.  Identity

   The identity resolution mechanism is trusted to associate long-term
   identifiers with their public signature-verification keys.
   (Transparency Services and other parties may record identity-
   resolution evidence to facilitate its auditing.)

   If one of the credentials of an Issuer gets compromised, the SCITT
   Architecture still guarantees the authenticity of all Signed
   Statements signed with this credential that have been registered on a
   Transparency Service before the compromise.  It is up to the Issuer
   to notify Transparency Services of credential revocation to stop
   Verifiers from accepting Signed Statements signed with compromised
   credentials.

   The confidentiality of any identity lookup during Signed Statement
   Registration or Transparent Statement Verification is out of scope.

11.  IANA Considerations

   TBD; Section 4.

11.1.  URN Sub-namespace for SCITT (urn:ietf:params:scitt)

   IANA is requested to register the URN sub-namespace
   urn:ietf:params:scitt in the "IETF URN Sub-namespace for Registered
   Protocol Parameter Identifiers" Registry [IANA.params], following the
   template in [RFC3553]:

      Registry name:  scitt

      Specification:  [RFCthis]

      Repository:  http://www.iana.org/assignments/scitt

      Index value:  No transformation needed.
