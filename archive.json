It's submitted to the transparency service and accepted as a result of any registration policies (`transparent statement`)\r\n\r\nPersonally, what I like about: it takes a generic document (`SBOM`, `VEX`, `scan result`, `artifact x meets foo conformance policy`, ...) and then uses the same noun (statement) with adjectives (`signed`, `transparent`) as it travels through the SCITT workflow.",

And because of that, the transition would in practice be document -> signed statement, which is confusing. \r\n\r\nI think statement -> signed statement makes sense, even though it's a bit cumbersome and a single word for the latter would be nicer (thinking of APIs etc.). In practice, I think that's where it ends, and whether receipts from one or more TS exist (and are bundled in some way) and whether verifiers therefore consider the signed statement as more or less transparent is a policy decision I think.

It reduces the number of concepts needed for understanding.

For instance, using an array of strings would capture many of the common patterns (such as product > model > release), and allow some advanced functions in the API (such as prefix-based querying). Another approach would be to allow each issuer to structure their feed using arbitrary CBOR representations; while this captures many more complex usages (e.g. packages for different Linux distributions, binaries for different architectures) it becomes harder for the transparency service to understand what constitutes related claims (it requires interpretation of the feed format), and thus, harder to define auditing APIs.",

The metadata AKA \"Artifact Properties\" is used for accessing the signed statements regarding data artifacts. There are two levels of properties: a) a base level which provides the licensee/owner, semantic label of the item, version, and category. The date submitted is calculated by the log manager. Category is used to determine the extended properties set. For example, for software use case, the base level would have Licensee:\"Company ABC\", ProductName:\"Widget package XYZ\", Version: \"2.1.3\", PropertiesCategory:\"sw\". In the extended set, we have properties such as a enumeration of possible artifact types, such SBOM, OCI container, binary, etc. \r\n\r\nThen, the registration policy includes 2 aspects. a) which property fields are completed so the item can be later accessed and b) whether the submitter is authorized to submit the item based on evaluating the signature on the submitted item.\r\n\r\nThe minimum metadata for each artifact must be specified in the base architecture, even if in some registration policies, no metadata is required. The extended metadata must be defined for the sw use case.\r\n\r\nThe signed statements that exist in the append only log must include both the base properties and optional (use-case specific) properties, these should be protected by any signatures, and they should not be encrypted nor considered part of the artifact.\r\n",

Some googling will surface a comparison of [Signature Formats. Envelopes and Wrappers and Formats, Oh My! by Dan Lorenc](https://dlorenc.medium.com/signature-formats-9b7b2a127473) which recommends DSSE over the family of JOSE standards, which includes COSE to some extent, though COSE is not covered in that article.\r\n\r\nI think we'd should try to promote interoperability with Sigstore.\r\n\r\nIs there some background info somewhere on advantages of mandating COSE?",

The current implementation of DSSE by SigStore as a starting point seems to be a weak reason to not use COSE.  From a technology point of view hoping the words Simple equals simple is not always true.  The future needs and extensibility of this space begs for mechanisms that pre-exist in COSE.  Having the IETF entertain a different signing serialization format pushes for it to be within the IETF.  Which COSE is.  I want to push back that before entertaining DSSE or something else bringing it to the IETF is the place to start.\r\n\r\nAsking if we should use S/MIME does meet that requirement listed above but picking one is a fair goal.  The COSE format is required for IOT devices and is built with all the knowledge of where S-MIME (and other formats) struggled, leads to it being top contender.  If you want to make a case why it is NOT a great choice, then please take pen to paper and make a case. \r\n\r\nIf the argument is that COSE is frozen and thus cannot be extended, that has been proven false in the current meetings.  The working groups have been very thoughtful and accepting of requirements such as Merkle proof receipts. \r\n\r\nIf the argument is that we should support more than one, we really need to have you explain your reasoning.",

This way the a human readable string might only be needed after a failed machine driven insert conversation (more than one call response).\r\n\r\nFor example  if the identity is an OIDC token with an invalid subject, the policy error could say what the subject and or other fields should contain or be set to.\r\n\r\n- References\r\n  - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#example-requiring-a-reusable-workflow\r\n  - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/using-openid-connect-with-reusable-workflows\r\n  - https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/issues/305) mentions wanting `job_workflow_ref,repository_id,repository_owner_id` to effectively pin auth to a known workflow.

      "body": "This issue summarizes discussions so far on references between transparent statements---see also slide 22 at the last IETF SCITT session. I am using \"reference\" below but identifier or URL may be better.  \r\n  \r\n**Motivation:** We need a standard way to refer to previously-registered statements. In particular, references to transparent statements may be included in new statements (in headers or payloads or receipts) to point, for example, to a policy statement, to some keying information, to a prior statement it replaces on a given stream, or to statements for artifacts it depends on in the supply chain. \r\n- Using a reference instead of a full transparent statement (or a full receipt) is more efficient (compact, enabling sharing/caching of common statements) and more transparent (everyone benefits from reviews/audits of common statements).\r\n- A reference to a transparent statement is more informative than a reference to its signed statement or its payload.\r\n- References enable federation and advanced registration policies. \r\n \r\n**Goals:**\r\n1. Given a transparent statement, we can compute its reference.\r\n2. Given a reference, we can discover its TS and transparent statement.\r\n3. A reference commits to a unique transparent statement.\r\n \r\n**Syntax:** references include both a locator and a commitment. Concretely, we may use DID URLs of the form \r\n \r\n`did:web:ts.software.org/42&digest=4ce2320130450...` \r\n \r\nwhere `42` is the serial registration index in the log of this TS and `digest` is the SHA256 hash of the transparent statement. \r\n\r\nWe may provide a more compact format by making the DID optional for local references within a TS, and making the digest optional when the transparent statement is attached.  \r\n\r\nWe may even just use the raw digest `4ce2320130450` as an opaque identifier (since the hash already authenticates the locator) and separately deal with locators.  \r\n \r\n**Discoverability** The TS, or an auxiliary database of transparent claims, may support transparent-statement lookups given their reference. This auxiliary lookup service is not a requirement (random access is hard to guarantee) and it need not be trusted (since clients can easily verify the receipt of the resulting transparent statement against their reference). Alternatively, a transparent statement may be distributed together with supporting transparent statements it refers to. This facilitates offline verification and auditing but is more verbose. Or it may include auxiliary headers to help retrieve the supporting statements from any other location.   \r\n\r\n**Open issues:**\r\n- A TS may produce multiple receipts for the same registered statement, hence multiple commitments with different digests. We could simply ignore the problem, and assume the \u201cprimary\u201d receipt is the first one produced by the TS. We could also provide flexibility, using something of the form \r\n  \r\n  `did:web:ts.software.org/42&registered=SHA256(signed statement)&digest=SHA256(receipt)`\r\n- Do we need different formats for different implementations? For example, we may use `digest-sha256=...` for agility; we also argued about a TS federating multiple logs, in which case we may need more than a serial registration index.\r\n \r\n",

If log A and log B had different entry id hash algorithms federation would involve an index or mapping so that federation mechanics don't end up re-inserting a claim which already exists Example: Log A federates Claim A1 to Log B. Log B inserts claim A1 as B1, federates event to Log A which inserts claims as A2. If entries were content addressable it would be fast to determine and A2 is in fact A1 and does not need to be re-inserted. If they aren't the same then a mapping transmitted with the federation event would include the known entry IDs within each log or something.",

For example, a monitor may be configured to report on all certificates that apply to a specific domain name when fetching new entries for consistency validation.\r\n\r\n* Auditing ensures that the current published state of a log is reachable from previously published states that are known to be good and that the promises made by the log, in the form of SCTs, have been kept. Audits are performed by monitors or TLS clients.\r\n\r\nI'm not up-to-date, but it would seem useful to define how the ecosystem can gain confidence that SCITT transparency logs are following the append-only rules, perhaps via similar roles as used in CT. Such client use cases may well have some different requirements for various aspects of the architecture or APIs, than what I'll call \"relying parties\" who are concerned with verifying a specific claim.",

              "body": "Thanks @nedmsmith \r\nThere's a combination of goal and boundary. \r\nThe goal of SCITT is to provide verified registration, based on the identity and a registration policy. This is why you see the authors focus on the notary concept. The notary doesn't evaluate the validatiy of the document that's being notarized. Rather the notary evaluates the trustworthiness of the identities signing. It's up to a consumer to decide if the content represents the info they can act upon. However, if you can't trust the issuer, the content is no different than a piece of info found \"on the street\", or \"on the web\".\r\n\r\nThe boundary, is related to SCITT doesn't evaluate the content. \r\n\r\nFor the Registered vs. Transparent Statement, @kaywilliams did open #20, which was duped to #8\r\n\r\nFWIW, I do see the concern with calling everything \"transparent\", when the contents may be opaque. Lets see if we can continue the conversation in #8 regarding terminology. \r\n",

A Notary writes entries to a Ledger. This also leaves the term Log available for diagnostics logs used to troubleshoot a Transparency Service.\r\n- **Transparency Service**: An entity operating an instance of this specification. Personally, I struggle as \"Transparent\" suggests everything is visible and public. We later discuss Opaque statements being placed in the Transparency Service. My personal suggestion is to call it a \"SCITT Registry\" and we leave the terms Transparent and Opaque to the types of payloads placed in the Statement.\r\n\r\nI've only completed to line 141, with an edit to terminology.  I'll try pickup later today.\r\nI've created this PR under a `consistency-fixes` branch here, so others can also make proposed changes.\r\n",

This can be optionally used to discover the receipt signing key. This change was originally proposed at the IETF WG meeting in London. It simplifies statement authorization, as verifiers can only trust the stable DID of the TS instead of worry about keys or certificate that may be rotated\r\n- Transparency services can now indicate the registration policies that were actually applied. This is very helpful for verifier, for instance to check the freshness of claims. This was proposed in Tokyo",

I just couldn't see how there could be 'one way'.\r\n\r\nIf it moves the world forward to stop talking about it and leave it out, we can of course work with that. It could always come a long later if it is realy as useful as I think it is.\r\n\r\nIt does seem to mean that trusted service implementations will all be inventing different ways to contextualise statements. Possibly that is actually the right thing, and scitt users should be aware of the specifics of each TS. \r\n\r\nThe presence of feed as 'a string' seemed to offer a really good baseline - as long as it didn't try to be opinionated about structure.",

Which endpoints they query is up to them. They could equally choose to NOT trust Coyote Security, (because who trusts the Coyote?), or because they're not tailored to the unique needs Cosmic Security addresses.\r\n\r\nIn the above case, `392: feed` is used to independently identify a collection of statements about an artifact, independently from the identity, and consistent across SCITT Transparency Service Instances\r\n\r\nIs the above usecase one we're trying to solve? \r\n- If not, what is the problem we're solving, and how would someone implement the above?\r\n- If so, does `392: feed` and `391: did` solve the problem?

      "body": "This is an attempt to break the deadlock on Feeds vs searchability etc.\r\n\r\nWithout making any normative changes (I hope!) I seek to clarify a handful of issues:\r\n\r\n- Why do we need Feed at all? Because it is the very simple but essential way of ensuring the desired goal of non-equivocation. It makes it practical to discover or eliminate equivocation through a very simple but powerful way of linking related Transparent Statements together, and providing a very simple way of enable pre-commitment for statements of fact and accountability. In less fancy but as useful ways it also ensures that the relying party or someone with a copy of one Transparent Statement in their hands can ensure completeness of the set they're evaluating, and confirm that they are up-to-date with supply chain information that can move very fast.\r\n\r\n- Does Feed need a structure? No, assuming the above is the purpose of grouping statements together then it doesn't mater what it's called as long as it's the same for all items in the group. This again cements the need for it to be in the Envelope though, since otherwise coordinating all the points in various systems that would need to know what value to put in there would be impractical. By having it in the Envelope anyone with a single Transparent statement from the Feed would know what to use for either making new statements or looking in the TS for related statements.\r\n\r\n- Can Feed just be a part of reg_info? No, because reg_info is defined for a very different purpose. Registration Policies are also very complicated and need work, but I don't think they need work to close this particular issue.\r\n\r\nWhile there are still clarity issues in the spec which I would love for us to address soon, I think this minimal change makes it possible to move on and removes the pollution from the discussion about types of identity, self-describing serialised data structures, and the like. Crucially, in keeping with the findings from -117, I believe it shows that it is possible to carry the 'findability' information that was required by the applications building on top of SCOITT building blocks without going outside our charter and defining things at the semantic or application layer.

This goes outside the scope of SCITT, but inside VEX and other formats. In formats I have helped design or maintain, you can look at pointers to records, before, after, or show me the most current (from a data model perspective, not that different from how the IETF Datatracker works when you visit an old draft; you do not need to visit a page and read all drafts in a single page at once).

Or at least something that it only imperfectly reflects.\r\n\r\nAs a trusted service implementor interested in making strong and clear assertions about completeness and non-equivocation over a series of statements, what do I do if I also see 'exp' or 'iat' in the context of 'iss' and 'sub' ? When I read a standard, from the perspective of a TS implementor again, that mentions just iss, and sub do I get to assume that I will never deal with those ?\r\n\r\nIf those are not permitted how is this actually a CWT ?\r\n\r\nThese things possibly have answers but I don't think my confusion will be an isolated one. What I would really like to see for feed id is wording like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTrusted Services MUST treat the feed id as an opaque series of bytes.\r\n Issuers MAY define encoding appropriate for their domain for the benefit\r\n of relying parties. Completeness and non-equivocation guarantees MUST \r\nonly be defined in terms of the opaque array of bytes comprising the feed id\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that permits issuers and relying parties full flexibility of expression _in the context_ of a very clearly articulated series of statements.\r\n\r\nIn otherwords, if we use 'sub' but define it that way, I don't see how it really is anything to do with 8392.\r\n\r\nAnd this would imply the restoration of DID.

The claims in a JWT are normally statements\r\n   about the subject.  The subject value MUST either be scoped to be\r\n   locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.\r\n   The processing of this claim is generally application specific.  The\r\n   \"sub\" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI\r\n   value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\r\n   \r\n This covers a few things we've discussed, such as:\r\n- `case-sensitivity` - which I personally find frustrating as someone trying to differentiate the difference between `a123` and `A123` is just creating a future frustration point for users that get confused why a query for one fails to find the other. However, specifying this is fine, and best practice would be to lowercase all ids- but I digress \ud83d\ude44 \r\n- `StringOrURI value` covers the various ways an issuer may choose to represent their Artifact Feed identifier.\r\n\r\nThe thing I'd like to test with this discussion is whether two or more parties can make statements about the same artifact.\r\n\r\n1. Wabbit Networks (_the identity_) releases their `net-monitor v1` software (_the Artifact_)\r\n1. Wabbit Networks publishes a Signed Statement using a `\"sub\": \"wabbitnetworks-netmonv3linux` and `\"iss\":=\"wabbitnetworks\"` on their `scitt.wabbit-networks.io` service. \r\n1. Wabbit Networks has an auditor publish a signed statement: `\"sub\": \"wabbitnetworks-netmonv3linux` and `\"iss\":=\"coyote-security\"` on the same `scitt.wabbit-networks.io` service.\r\n1. Cosmic security, Mitre and other independent publishers make statements about the same Artifact\r\n    - `\"sub\": \"wabbitnetworks-netmonv3linux` and `\"iss\":=\"cosmicsecurity\"` on their `scitt.cosmic-security.io` service. \r\n    - `\"sub\": \"wabbitnetworks-netmonv3linux` and `\"iss\":=\"mitre\"` on their `scitt.mitre.org` service. \r\n\r\nAs a consumer, ACME Rockets can\r\n- query the `scitt.wabbit-networks.io` service, to get statements associated with the net-monitor v1 software package. \r\n- query `scitt.mitre.org` for any public statements, using `\"sub\": \"wabbitnetworks-netmonv3linux` as the means to find statements from Mitre for the Wabbit Networks, net-monitor v1 software.\r\n- optionally query `scitt.cosmic-security.io` as they specialize in aerospace software, providing deeper insights for the specific aerospace vertical.\r\n\r\nACME Rockets (_the consumer_) can choose to trust the statements because they trust the independent identities making statements. Which endpoints they query is up to them. They could equally choose to NOT trust Coyote Security, (because who trusts the Coyote), or because they're not tailored to the unique needs Cosmic Security addresses.\r\n\r\nCan `subject` be used to independently identify a collection of statements about an artifact, independently from the issuer, and consistent across SCITT Transparency Service Instances?",

With respect I just don't agree with what I understand of its intent :-)\r\n\r\nIs there  something you can\u2019t achieve where the CWT is just binary encoded in the feed id ? Provided everyone agrees the envelope feed id is an opaque string nobody needs to refer to the combination of other standards and specific reg policies to get base line confidence over the context for a series of statements.\r\n\r\nI beleive having any structure in the feed id will gaurantee divergent and incompatible combinations of TS, issuer, series-of-statements. In particular, regarding the re-use of 'sub', I base this assertion on significant practical exposure to iss/sub in the context of identity providers & JWT's.\r\n\r\nIf we go the structured road we will lose the opportunity to define a single universal means to identify a complete series of statements in the envelope of the statement.\r\n\r\nWith a single property, defined as an opaque byte string, I believe we will get a simplicity that is enabling rather than limiting: On top of that base, richer interpretations can be built for TS's and issuers that wish to be mutualy content aware. And all TS implementations can guarantee a base level of utility before considering added value.\r\n\r\nYet consumers of those same feeds, regardless of origin, will still enjoy the base line ability to correlate the series of statements and demonstrate completeness and so on.\r\n\r\n> It seems easier to make it clear, by reusing other specs, that provide context for implementers.\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a prospective implementor I  feel the opposite.\r\n\r\n> Can subject be used to independently identify a collection of statements about an artifact, independently from the issuer, and consistent across SCITT Transparency Service Instances?\r\n\r\nProvided that its value is opaque to the TS for the purposes of defining the complete series, yes I believe so.

      "body": "This attempts to resolve the balance between a generic string and a structured string for how issuers and verifiers can identify \"a sequence of Signed Statements about the same Artifact.\", as [currently defined](https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/blob/main/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture.md?plain=1#L189)\r\n\r\nChanging to `bstr` enables an issuer to set the `Feed` to be a `sub`, and it also allows an issuer to use other identifier formats. \r\n\r\nThere's a great suggestion to use `sub`, as part of the CTW (PR #108). And at first it looks fairly simple.\r\n```cddl\r\nCWT_Claims = {\r\n  1 => tstr; iss, the issuer that is making statements\r\n  2 -> tstr; sub, the subject about which the statements are made, throughout this spec, this is also called feed.\r\n * tstr => any\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe challenge is a CWT_Claim is far more expressive [as defined](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cwt/cwt.xhtml)\r\n\r\nFor an issuer and a verifier to clearly identify the specific artifact they are referencing with CWT_Claims, it would be both powerful and confusing for an issuer to specify which CWT_Claims properties they were using to identify the feed.\r\n\r\nAn issuer could add: \r\n\r\n```cddl\r\nCWT_Claims = {\r\n  1 => tstr; iss, the issuer that is making statements\r\n  2 -> tstr; sub, the subject about which the statements are made, throughout this spec, this is also called feed.\r\n  256 -> bstr; ueid, The Universal Entity ID \r\n  260 -> array; hwversion, the Hardware Version Identifier\r\n  2395 -> uint; psa-security-lifecycle, PSA Security Lifecycle\t\r\n   * tstr => any\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the text in PR #103, changing the Feed to `bstr`, makes it clear the Feed is:\r\n\r\n> Feed:\r\n> : a logical collection of Statements about the same Artifact.\r\n> For any step or set of steps in a supply chain there will be multiple statements made about the same Artifact. Issuers use the Feed to create a coherent sequence of Signed Statements about the same Artifact and Verifiers use the Feed to ensure completeness and non-equivocation in supply chain evidence by identifying all Transparent Statements linked to the one(s) they are evaluating.\r\nFixe #11 ",

My personal take but we should not rush to make it to IETF 118, until all other authors approve of the change!\r\n\r\n@yogeshbdeshpande  I appreciate the feedback. We have been asking for feedback for several days and we're now at the deadline. Without merging this content, we're asking the rest of IETF community to not benefit from the cleaned up consistency across the document.  As editor, the consistency of the doc as a stable reference point provides more clarity for the consumer. As it's still a draft, we will continue to take feedback, but we really need to publish the best version we have. The version prior to this change has duplicate, inconsistent references.",
